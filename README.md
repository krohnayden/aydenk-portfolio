# AydenK Portfolio

## Description

Through this project, my goal was to make a webpage that can house my previous work in a portfolio. In my porfolio, I provide a brief description of myself, a collection of my previously made webpages, as well as a way to contact me. This website provided me with a way to showcase my knowledge in coding using HTML and CSS. In making my portfolio, I learned more about the importance of structure and syntax in both my HTML and CSS code. Additionally, I learned more about how to style my website using specific CSS properties like text-align, justify content, and root tags.

## Installation
